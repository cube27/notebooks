      "\n",
      "     1. Saving/Reusing Work:\n",

      "\n",
      "7. Zipline Notebook\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Research Env Sneak Peek:\n",
      "\n",
      "   - We've seen that IPython Notebook acts as a nice middle ground between the\n",
      "     static nature of a script/library and the dynamic (but impermanent) nature\n",
      "     of a shell session.\n",
      "\n",
      "   - We've also seen that IPython Notebook enables sharing computation, which\n",
      "     includes not just Python code but also data visualizations, documentation,\n",
      "     and other content.\n",
      "\n",
      "   - And we've seen that we can use IPython Notebook with the state of the art\n",
      "     tools (like `pandas` and `zipline`) to get even more out of these tools.\n",
      "\n",
      "   - Said at the start that we're thinking now about how to make the research\n",
      "     process on Quantopian better...\n",
      "\n",
      "     - Open ssh session to AWS, show running notebook process.\n",
      "\n",
      "     - One of the most powerful features of notebook is the fact that it you\n",
      "       don't actually need to be running the notebook server to connect to and\n",
      "       edit a notebook.\n",
      "\n",
      "     - We want to make it possible for people to run notebooks on our computing\n",
      "       environment in a way that can still take advantage of all awesome data\n",
      "       sources and APIs that are currently only available on Quantopian.\n",
      "\n",
      "     - Load up a couple days' worth of minute bars in to a panel.\n",
      "\n",
      "     - This is that data that we pipe through your Quantopian algorithms every\n",
      "       day, but now in an environment where you can explore it interactively.\n",
      "\n",
      "     - This project is in a **very** early alpha, but we're very excited about\n",
      "       the possibilities this opens up.  We're already starting to use the idea\n",
      "       of remote notebooks in our internal research and operations efforts."
